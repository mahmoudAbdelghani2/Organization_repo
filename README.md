The tasks are organized in the files task1 and task2, and I’ll keep adding new files as more tasks are assigned.

The test file contains the examples explained in each section — I write them and solve them myself so I can review them later if needed.

Special thanks to you, Eng. Norhan, for your great effort and continuous support with us.
